1. Gaea is a greek word meaning "earth".
2. Terra is a latin term for "earth".
3. A browser game that have lots of activities like no other.
4. One day in-game is equal to one day in real life.
5. To Factions: (a) Gaea and (b) Terra.
6. Inside Gaea and Terra realms is a safezone.
7. Places in the safezone are:
(a) Capitol (housing sector, etc.), 
(b) Trade Center (different stores), 
(c) Library (where you can get/buy recipe scroll, etc.),
(d) Bank (w/ 5-15% interest to all deposits),

9. If you leave safezone, you will be entering "ExoApo", a greek word means outside.
10. Outside safezone players can kill and be killed.
11. Rare materials and ingredients can be found outside.
12. There is a place outside called "Promise Land" where rare materials, etc. can be found.
13. "Promise Land" can only be occupied by one faction, either Gaeans or Terrans.
14. Once a day, Gaeans and Terrans battles for occupation of "Promise Land".
15. Only the members of the winning faction can enter the "Promise Land".
16. Faction territories can be extended.
17. Extended areas can be taken by the other faction.
18. That's all I can think of right now. Thanks for helping.
